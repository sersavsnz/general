# Models
Here I would like to collect up-to-date information on interesting models

# NLP
- The [Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) 
model is fine-tuned from a 7B LLaMA model on 52K instruction-following data generated by the techniques in the Self-Instruct paper, with some modifications. The Alpaca 7B model behaves similarly to the text-davinci-003 model on the Self-Instruct. We intend to release the model weights if we are given permission to do so by the creators of LLaMA.

 - [ControlNet](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hysts/ControlNet) is a neural network structure to control diffusion models by adding extra conditions (additional image)
